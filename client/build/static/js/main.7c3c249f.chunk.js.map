Except as otherwise provided herein, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of the Federal Judicial Circuit in which Perfect Keto’s principle place of business is located, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Within ten (10) calendar days after the arbitration demand is served upon a party, the parties must jointly select an arbitrator with at least five years’ experience in that capacity and who has knowledge of and experience with the subject matter of the dispute. If the parties do not agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) calendar days, a party may petition the AAA to appoint an arbitrator, who must satisfy the same experience requirement. In the event of a dispute, the arbitrator shall decide the enforceability and interpretation of this arbitration agreement in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). The parties also agree that the AAA’s rules governing Emergency Measures of Protection shall apply in lieu of seeking emergency injunctive relief from a court. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and no party shall have rights of appeal except for those provided in section 10 of the FAA. Each party shall bear its share of the fees paid for the arbitrator and the administration of the arbitration; however, the arbitrator shall have the power to order one party to pay all or any portion of such fees as part of a well-reasoned decision. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to award attorneys’ fees only to the extent expressly authorized by statute or contract. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages and each party hereby waives any right to seek or recover punitive damages with respect to any dispute resolved by arbitration. The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and this agreement does not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding.

from May to August. When I started the plan it was solely to assist me loosing weight - Ketones gave the boost to get up an extra hour to go for jog or a workout, suppressed my appetite while I adjusted to my healthy eating plan and I noticed I wasn't reaching for any sugary snacks. Now I've dropped the weight I continue for a number of reasons. The program helps me stay focused at work and tasks like housework don't seem as much as a drag because I'm motivated. I have a large busy family life and without realising it I manage to run my household and parent 100 times more effective and I've been told my partner I'm not half as moody as I used to be. When I heard other people stories/reviews I thought it was too good to be true but this has made me feel new again I'm so optimistic about my future and what I'll will achieve with my new lease of life.\",\r\n    image: KarleeImage,\r\n    name: 'Karlee',\r\n    country: 'UK'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    text: \"Before I started this program, I was constantly tired and unmotivated to do anything. I had terrible up and down mood swings and genuinely felt like I was stuck in a rut not knowing were life was going to take me. This also contributed to me making unhealthy decisions and LBS creeping up on me.Now I can honestly say I'm becoming a better version of myself everyday! I wake up every morning ready to take on the day with more motivation, focus, reduced brain fog and a hell of a lot more energy. I have also seen a massive improvement in my self esteem, I don't feel as worried and I now enjoy life again! The added bonus' for me was watching my skin improve, sleeping like a baby and dropping some lbs (25 in total so far).\",\r\n    image: NatashaImage,\r\n    name: 'Natasha',\r\n    country: 'UK'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    text: \"Well I was always big as a youngster and got as you can see from picture the weight got totally out of hand, but for some reason at the time was not that bothered because a martial artist I could still do the splits, kick to the head and lots of stuff so didn't bother me.Now when I look back at it I think to myself how can you let yourself get in that state. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Wow. I had lost about 11 stone before I started these protocols but had a stroke and gained a lot of weight back… Now this has changed everything. Not only have I lost 4 stone, but I have better sleep, more energy, less stress, better mood, better focus, & better digestion… In short I feel fantastic and its so much easier than the way I tried to do it before.\",\r\n    image: LeoImage,\r\n    name: 'Leo',\r\n    country: 'UK'\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n\r\nconst GetDietResult = ({ diet: { gender, bodyfat, activityLevel, age, height, weight, desiredWeight, goals, describes } }) => {\r\n\r\n  const [result, setResult] = React.useState(null)\r\n  const [series, setSeries] = React.useState([44, 55, 13])\r\n  const [BMI, setBMI] = React.useState(0)\r\n  const [dailyWaterIntake, setDailyWaterIntake] = React.useState(0)\r\n\r\n  const options = {\r\n    chart: {\r\n      type: 'pie',\r\n    },\r\n    labels: ['Net Carbs', 'Protein', 'Fat'],\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  React.useEffect(() => {\r\n    const others = {\r\n      calorieAdjustment: (desiredWeight - weight) / weight * 100\r\n    }\r\n    const params = {\r\n      gender: core.Gender[gender],\r\n      age,\r\n      weight,\r\n      bodyfat,\r\n      height,\r\n      activityLevel,\r\n      netCarbs: Math.abs(others.calorieAdjustment) < 20 ? 25 : others.calorieAdjustment > 20 ? 20 : 30\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var kdb = new core.KetoDietBuddy(params)\r\n    var result = kdb.calculateCalorieIntake(others.calorieAdjustment)\r\n\r\n    setDailyWaterIntake((weight * 30 / 28.3 / 33.81).toFixed(1))\r\n    setBMI((weight / (height / 100) ** 2).toFixed(1))\r\n\r\n    setResult(result.desirable)\r\n    setSeries([result.desirable.percEnergyNetCarbs, result.desirable.percEnergyProtein, result.desirable.percEnergyFat])\r\n  }, [activityLevel, age, bodyfat, desiredWeight, gender, height, weight])\r\n\r\n\r\n  if (!gender) {\r\n    return <Redirect to='/' />\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className='get-diet-result'>\r\n      <div className='page-question text-center text-white my-4'>\r\n        <div className='row'>\r\n          <div className='col-md-2'></div>\r\n          <div className='col-md-8'>\r\n            <div className='font-36 font-weight-800'>Your Keto Analysis is complete!</div>\r\n            <div className='text-left text-white font-18'>\r\n              <div className='my-1'>\r\n                <span className='text-success'>Success Probability </span>: Expremely high compatibility with a ketogenic program; high success expected\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div className='my-1'>\r\n                <span className='text-success'>Similar Demographic Success Rate </span>: 95 - 98%\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div className='my-1'>\r\n                *when following metabolic profile procedures.\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div className='my-1 font-15'>\r\n                <span className='text-success'>Given your unique profile</span>, the ideal program for your body would be the meta-flex keto plan.\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div className='my-1 font-15'>\r\n                With this program that is specifically tailored for your food preferences, activity level, and lifestyle, it expected to take less that 21 days to notice a profound shift towards your goal of:\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className='my-3 text-left'>\r\n              {goals.map((item, index) =>\r\n                item ?\r\n                  <div key={index} className='d-inline-block p-2' style={{ width: '145px' }}>\r\n                    <img alt='SETIMAGE' src={goalList[index].image} className='img-fluid rounded-lg' />\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  : null\r\n              )}\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className='my-3 font-24'>\r\n              Plus this is the perfect program for individuals with your specific challenges\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className='my-3 text-left'>\r\n              {describes.map((item, index) =>\r\n                (item && index > 0) ?\r\n                  <div key={index} className='d-inline-block p-2' style={{ width: '145px' }}>\r\n                    <img alt='SETIMAGE' src={describeList[index].image} className='img-fluid rounded-lg' />\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  : null\r\n              )}\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className='my-4 text-left'>\r\n              <div className='font-24 text-success'>\r\n                Our Unique Keto Analysis Program\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div className='font-15 text-white text-justify'>\r\n                Our program has integrated data from thousands of studies to develop a comprehensive report showing you exactly how to achieve your health and fitness goals.
